# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

# Overview 

Upper management has notified both Jeremy and the data analytics team about AutoRU's newest prototype, MechaChar. The prototype, however, is suffering from production troubles, all of which inhibits the manufacturing teamâ€™s progress. As a result, we have been tasked to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team. We performed multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes. We also collected summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils, and ran t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots were statistically different from the mean population. Lastly, we designed a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. 


### Linear Regression to Predict MPG
________________________________________________________
- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?



### Summary Statistics on Suspension
________________________________________________________
- Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?



### T-Tests on Suspension Coils
________________________________________________________

- What metric or metrics are you going to test?
- What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
- What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
- What data is needed to run the statistical test?
