### Linear Regression to Predict MPG
________________________________________________________
- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?



### Summary Statistics on Suspension
________________________________________________________
- Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?



### T-Tests on Suspension Coils
________________________________________________________

### Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition 
________________________________________________________

- What metric or metrics are you going to test?
- What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
- What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
- What data is needed to run the statistical test?
